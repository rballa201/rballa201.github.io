				<p class="text-justify">This following page will take you through step by step on how to use the API that we used effectively and how to use the visualisation 
					for this page as well.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">So, for the weather webpage, we used two different API calls to gain the data we needed for the website but before we call the APIs we 
					first need to make an Ajax request.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">An Ajax request main purpose is to update a webpage asynchronously, meaning a user will not have to refresh a webpage for a tiny change 
					to take effect. There are four main features to an ajax request the first would be to update a webpage without reloading it, the second would be to request 
					data from a server after the page has loaded up, the third would be to receive data after a page has loaded up and the forth would be to send data to a server 
					and this would happen in the background. </p>
				<p class="text-justify">To use an Ajax request we first need to implement jQuery. jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library, this means that writing in JavaScript 
					will become a lot easier as with this library implemented tasks that use to require a lot of lines of code to function now require less as the jQuery library 
					will most likely have useful functions that the developer could use. The jQuery library will also help simplify the Ajax requests that will be seen throughout 
					this website.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">The API call that we use for this page to gain the earthquake locations in the following:<br>
					<b>//eathquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/ + earthquakePwr +.geojson</b><br>For this API call how it needs to work is for the earthquakePwr variable 
					to have the required data. The required data for this variable can vary depending on what the user wishes to view. For example, if the user wishes to view all 
					earthquakes in the past week the variable would be all_week. </p>
				<p class="text-justify">As the user has multiple options when they want to view the earthquake data we decided to create our own function called populateMap() and 
					the variable getting passed into this function would be the one that determines what type of earthquake and how long ago it happened. We implemented this function 
					as it will decrease the amount of code on the screen and it will also make it easier to edit this section of code.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">The Ajax request that we use for this page is within the populateMap() function and when it is successful it will start to store the data 
					that is needed. It does this by creating an array called markers and then using the .each method it will then loop through the array of data we have received 
					from the API and store the latitude and longitude for each earthquake. Still, within the .each method, it will now loop through the marker array and store the 
					latitude and longitude that it had just got and store it in a position in the array and then show the marker on the map.</p><br><br>
				<p class="text-justify">The visualisation being used for this page is the map from google maps. We gain this map by importing it in the HTML section of this page. 
					The data is then being visualised on the map as a marker we then use google maps inbuilt function to cluster the markers.</p>

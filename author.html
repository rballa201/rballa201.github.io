				<h3>Callum Neilson</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">I am Callum Neilson during the creation of this website my roles were the project manager of 
					the project and the Business analyst of the webpage.<br>As the project manager one of my first tasks was to read 
					the project spec and determine the requirements that had to be followed out. As the project manager I also determined 
					the roles each member would undertake, and I did this by having a discussion with each member and determining what roles 
					they would excel in best.<br>As the Business analyst I made the structure diagram that would later help the web 
					developers creating the website.</p>

				<h3>Paul Kerr</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">My name is Paul Kerr and my rolls throughout the project life cycle were tester, lead documenter 
					and Business analyst. Notable things that I developed during the construction of the project were a large majority of 
					the diagrams produced in the initiation stage that were then revisited and updated for the group report as well as the 
					poster presented.<br>As well as this the development of the group report was finalised by me and Callum before submission. 
					Along with this I also worked on the design of the UI. With help from fellow designer Ryan Ballantine we managed to agree 
					upon key visual elements such as suitable colours, a consistent layout for each page.<br>Finally, as lead tester I was 
					responsible with producing the acceptance tests that would be used to finalise whether the finished system met the set-out 
					requirements to meet the customers' expectations as well as making sure that all registered faults are notified to the rest 
					of the team to be addressed before the applications deployment.</p>

				<h3>Gregor Baikie</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">I’m Gregor Baikie, within the group I work as a UI Designer and Web Developer. My duties consisted of 
					working alongside the fellow members of my team to establish the look of the website through design principles and implement 
					them. I am one of the members of the group with experience in User Psychology which allows me to contribute to discussion 
					regarding design principles based on UX.<br>I achieved the design of our application by learning and utilising the Bootstrap 
					4.0 framework in order to mimic the approved wireframes.<br>I was also involved in the displaying of information through 
					visualisation with collected data from external sources, which was achieved using jQuery – a JavaScript library - to implement 
					AJAX calls.</p>

			<section class="content author-name even">
				<h3>Ryan Ballantine</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">My Name is Ryan Ballantine and during the creation of this website my roles were web developer and UI 
					Designer. As a Web Developer alongside Gregor we created all the webpages and made sure that all the data was being called from 
					quality API’s and being Displayed properly.<br>As a UI Designer Paul and I worked together in order to find a look and colour 
					scheme for our webpages that we felt would suit the project. During development I oversaw that most of the pages were receiving 
					data from the API’s and were displaying them in unique visualisations.</p>

				<p class="text-justify">This following page will take you through step by step on how to use the API that we used 
					effectively and how to use the visualisation for this page as well.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">So, for the pathfinder webpage, we used one API to gain the data we needed for the website 
					but before we call the APIs we first need to make an Ajax request.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">An Ajax request main purpose is to update a webpage asynchronously, meaning a user will not 
					have to refresh a webpage for a tiny change to take effect. There are four main features to an ajax request the 
					first would be to update a webpage without reloading it, the second would be to request data from a server after 
					the page has loaded up, the third would be to receive data after a page has loaded up and the forth would be to 
					send data to a server and this would happen in the background.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">To use an Ajax request we first need to implement jQuery. jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript 
					library, this means that writing in JavaScript will become a lot easier as with this library implemented tasks that 
					use to require a lot of lines of code to function now require less as the jQuery library will most likely have useful 
					functions that the developer could use. The jQuery library will also help simplify the Ajax requests that will be seen 
					throughout this website.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">For this page specifically, there is two Ajax requests one to populate the dropdown box with the 
					required variable names of the qualifications and the other is to populate the doughnut chart with the data that is 
					linked to the qualification. If the call is successful it will continue with the code that we have made if It isn’t 
					successful, then it will show an error message to the user.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">The API call that this webpage uses to populate the dropdown box with is the following:
					<br><b>//api.lmiforall.org.uk/api/v1/hesa/list-courses</b><br>Using this API call we store the list of qualifications 
					within an array and we also store the ID that is linked to the course name in a different array. With the name 
					now stored in an array, we can now populate the dropdown box by using a for loop until it reaches the array length. 
					In this, for loop, we have appended the course ID variable and course name into the dropdown box. We have also added 
					in a massive if statement as 36 courses returns null values back to us so to avoid errors within the doughnut chart 
					we implemented this if statement to not show the null value qualifications within the drop-down box.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">The second Ajax request will be called when a user chose one of the options from the 
					dropdown box and it will continue to be called if the user cycles through the options.<br>The API call that will be 
					used in this Ajax request is the following:<br><b>//api.lmifotall.org.uk/api/v1/hesa/occupations?courses=</b><br>This 
					API currently will not work if you were to use it as it is missing a core part and that is the courses variable. The 
					variable that must be entered here isn’t the course name, it is the ID that is linked to the name. We get this ID by 
					declaring a new variable and using the getElementByID method we can get the specified ID by itself. Now we just add 
					this new variable into the end of the API call. This will now get us the data to be put into the doughnut chart.<br>
					This API will return with a big list of job titles that have a percentage number linked to them over the previous 4 
					years. For this page, we will only be using the most recent year's data.</p><br><br>
				<p class="text-justify">The Visualisation that is being used for this page is a doughnut chart. In the doughnut chart, we 
					will be showing the percentage of people in a specified job with the users chosen education. The doughnut chart will 
					only have 10 sections as we decided this would get the best visual appeal out of it. To get the data itself into the 
					doughnut chart we must look into the second Ajax request. If the Ajax request passes, then there will be a loop that 
					will bind the job name and percentage to an individual section of the doughnut chart until all the sections are filled.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">There is also a click event for each section of the doughnut chart where when the section is clicked 
					on the user will be taken to a job finder site that will already have searched for that sections job and this is done 
					through the following webpage:<br><b>//www.indeed.co.uk/jobs?q=+label+&1=</b><br>Where the variable label will be the jobs name.</p>

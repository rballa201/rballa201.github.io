			<section class="content overview">
				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p class="text-justify">The purpose of the integrated project is for our team to create a web application that 
					will demonstrate how to access data through the use of API’s and then visualise the data. For those who are 
					unaware on what an API is, it is essentially the user interface for machines. The easiest way to describe it 
					would be comparing an API to a phone and the machine to a person where the machine will use an API to gain 
					information just like how a person can use their phone to gain information.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">In this web application the team was made aware that altogether there would be six webpages 
					that would use API’s to gain data then visualise said data. The project spec has made it clear for the team what 
					two of the webpages would entail however the other four web pages were up to the team's own imagination. The team
					was also made aware that each webpage would have a tutorial webpage linked to it and the tutorial webpage will 
					briefly explain the visualisation techniques being used, aspects of the data contents, where to source the data 
					and the API access.</p>
				<p class="text-justify"><br>The two webpages that the project spec specifies to create are the following:</p>
			</section>
			<section class="content earthquake">
				<h3>Earthquake</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">When a user enters the earthquake page, they will see a map on the webpage that will remind 
					them of google maps and this is due to It being the google maps map. On screen it will also show several buttons 
					that will populate the map with different data markers to do with earthquakes. The markers that appear on the map 
					represent an earthquake that has occurred.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">For all the buttons that will be mentioned each one will have the functionality of showing 
					clustered markers. This means that any marker that will overlap another or in close proximity to another will join 
					together and the new marker will have a number on it that relates to the number of markers that are clustered. Users 
					will be able to click on the clustered marker to zoom in on the map to un-cluster the marker.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Another feature that all buttons will have will be that when a single marker is shown the marker will 
					have a number on it representing the magnitude of the earthquake.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">The final feature that all buttons will have will be that when a single marker is clicked on an info 
					window will appear. On this info window there will be a link that will open up a new page that when opened will populate the 
					page with relevant info about the area of where the earthquake happened.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">On the screen there are 5 buttons and 4 radio buttons. The 4 radio buttons are titled past hour, past day, 
					past week and past 30 days. The 5 buttons are titled All earthquakes, 1.0+ Earthquakes, 2.5+ Earthquakes, 4.5+ Earthquakes and 
					Significant. For the user to populate the map with markers they will first have to choose one of the radio buttons and then click 
					on one of the five buttons. For example, a user choses Past Day and then clicks on All Earthquakes the map will then be populated 
					with markers of All Earthquakes that have happened in the past day.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="content weather">
				<h3>Weather</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">On this page the user will be able to view relevant weather information as well as a relevant whether image by 
					either entering in the latitude and longitude of the location they wish to view, or the user will enter in the location name.  </p>
				<p class="text-justify">To do this the user will click on either the latitude and longitude button to unlock the latitude and longitude 
					input fields or the user will click on the location button to unlock the location input field. When the user clicks on one of the 
					buttons the opposite input fields will be locked so the user will be only able to enter latitude and longitude or the location and 
					never be able to do both.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Once the user has entered their chosen input field, they will then hit the button submit to view a weather image 
					relevant to the weather of the location they have entered as well as showing useful information relevant to the weather feed.</p>
				<p class="text-justify"><br>The four other webpages that the team was tasked on making was to come from our imagination, so the team decided 
					on creating the following webpages:  </p>
			</section>
			<section class="content crime">
				<h3>Crime Finder</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">On this page a user will be able to see the various reports of crime in a specified area. The user will be able to
					see this by entering in the chosen location they wish to view in the the textbox available. The date box is optional as
					if the user does not enter anything then the data recieved back will be using the current month as the date. The user must ensure that the location entered 
					is within the United Kingdom they must also be aware that due to the API works there is not much data recorded for Scotland.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Once the user has entered information into the requred fields they will now only have to click on the button to view the data
					in a horizontal bar graph.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="content word-synonym">
				<h3>Word Synonym</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">On this page the user will be able to view a words different synonyms. When a user first enters the page the user will
					see a box in the center of the screen in the box is a spider diagram. In the center of the spider diagram is the default word that the team has chosen 
					and it is brown. Branching off from this word is the different synonyms of the word. 
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">For a user to change the spider diagram they can go about this one of two ways. The first would be to click on one of the words that 
					have branched off. When they do this teh center word will then change to the word that was just clicked on and the branching words will then change to 
					the new synonym words.
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify">The second way that the spider diagram can be changed would be for the user to click on the center word and a text box will appeazr 
					with the chosen word already entered into it. The user can then change the word to any word of theire liking and then click enter. Once that is done the 
					spider diagram will then change to match to the new word that was entered.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="content education">
				<h3>Qualifications</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">For this page the user will be able to see what occupation they could possibly get through a specified qualification. 
					This is done by the user first choosing an education in the drop-down menu once done the doughnut chart will be populated.  A doughnut chart 
					key will then be shown this will allow the user to understand what each colour represents. The doughnut chart will show the percentage of people 
					in a specified job with the user’s chosen education.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="content population">
				<h3>Population</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">For this page the user will see be able to see the different countries population size. This is shown through an image of the world 
					in map form. The map will be coloured differently than what it is usually as we are showing the population size through colour. The colours that are 
					chosen to do this were chosen as it gives the idea to the user that they are seeing in infrared meaning the warmer a country is the more population they 
					have.</p>
			</section>
			<p class ="Java link" id="Java"><p><br>
			<section class="content Java Script techniques">
				<h3>Java Script techniques</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">When coding this project, we will be using some JavaScript to create the web pages, within JavaScript there are things called JavaScript 
					techniques. A JavaScript technique is a way of improving the readability of the code and the general performance and resource usage of the code.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">One JavaScript technique that we used was the use of proper variable names, this is an important technique to make use of as it improves 
					the readability of the code as using proper variable names makes it easier to follow code, debug the code and it makes it easier to understand what each 
					variable stores as it will have a name appropriate to its use.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Another JavaScript technique that we have made use of for the code is, we used text indentation properly. This technique is important 
					to the code readability as it helps to show where loops start and being using indentation as the start of a loop and the end will be less indented than the 
					inside of the loop which means it is easier to follow and understand loops.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">One other way of using JavaScript techniques to improve the readability of the code is to use comments throughout the development process. 
					Through the use of comments we can see what each function does, what each variable is used for and what every class is for, this helps improve the readability 
					of the code as using comments means that is easier to quickly find and maintain any problem areas of code as it is already described for us.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Browser developer tool is a technique that the team frequently used as this tool is most commonly used when a developer is debugging their 
					code. With the help of this debugger tool the developers will be able to find where the main errors are with ease. This tool will be used mostly during the development 
					phase as the developers will use this during their unit testing.</p>

			<p class="Geo link" id="Geo"></p><br>
			<section class="content GeoJson">
				<h3>GeoJson</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">Within this website, we are required to make use of geographical data in order for some of the webpages to function. The two main 
					pages that require geographical data for the API’S to run are the Earthquakes page and the Weather page. For these API’S to run and function correctly we 
					will be using geographical data in the GEOJSON format.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">GEOJSON is the standard format for displaying geographical types and data, the types that are supported by this format are, Points, 
					LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString and MultiPolygon.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Points are used to display a singular geometrical point, this is also the simplest form of geometrical data that GEOJSON will display 
					as the data is only displayed in one point, and this could be used to identify 1 singular area of geographical interest.<br>LineStrings are used to display 
					two points of geographical data that are connected through a line, this could be used to calculate the distance between 2 geographical areas of interest.<br>
					Polygons are the more complex GEOJSON data types, this is where we have 4 points that are mapped out to display a polygon shape, and this could be used to 
					represent a large area of geographical interest such as the area with the most earthquakes in a month.<br>The data types that are multi are simply used to 
					support more than one data entry.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">For the Earthquakes page the API will read in the data and then display all the points on a map that the earthquakes have happened over 
					a period of time, for this to function properly we will use GEOJSON multi points as we will display multiple points of geographical interest.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">For the weather page we will also be using multipoint as the data type due to the pages API displaying the weather as a single point for 
					that day.</p>
